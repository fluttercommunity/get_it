<blockquote>
<p><strong>Breaking Change with V2.0.0</strong> 
you no longer can directly create instances of the type <code>GetIt</code> because <code>GetIt</code> is now a singleton please see <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="important-you-have-to-use-dart2-to-use-this-component"><strong>IMPORTANT: You have to use Dart2 to use this component</strong></h3>
<p>You can find here a <a href="https://www.burkharts.net/apps/blog/one-to-find-them-all-how-to-use-service-locators-with-flutter/">detailed blog post on how to use GetIt</a></p>
<p>This is a simple <strong>Service Locator</strong> for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/reactiveui/splat">Splat</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not familiar with the concept of Service Locators, its a way to decouple the interface (abstract base class) from a concrete implementation and at the same time allows to access the concrete implementation from everywhere in your App over the interface.
I can only highly recommend to read this classic article by from Martin Fowler <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection  pattern</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Accessing an object from anywhere in an App especially can be done by other ways too but:</p><ul><li>If you use a Singleton you cannot easily switch the implementation to another like a mock version for unit tests</li><li>IoC containers for Dependency Injections offer a similar functionality but with the cost of slow start-up time and less readability because you don't know where the magically injected object come from. As most IoC libs rely on reflection they cannot be used with Flutter. </li></ul>
<p>Typical usage:</p><ul><li>Accessing service objects like REST API clients, databases so that they easily can be mocked.</li><li>Accessing View/AppModels/Managers from Flutter Views</li><li>Because interface and implementations are decoupled you could also register Flutter Views with different implementations and decide at start-up which one you want to use e.g. depending on screen resolutions</li></ul>
<p><strong>Extremely important if you use GetIt: ALWAYS use the same style to import your project files either as relative paths OR as package which I recommend. DON'T mix them because currently Dart treats types imported in different ways as two different types although both reference the same file.</strong></p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p><strong>Before V2.0.0</strong>
As Dart supports global (or euphemistic ambient) variables I decided after some discussions with Simon Lightfoot and Brian Egan to use just a simple class (so that you can if you really need even create more than one Locator although <strong>I would not advise to do that</strong>  in most cases).</p>
<p><strong>Since 2.0.0</strong>
Although the approach with a global variable worked well, it has its limitations if you want to use <code>GetIt</code> across multiple packages. Therefore now GetIt itself is a singleton and the default way to access an instance of <code>GetIt</code> is to call:</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">GetIt getIt = GetIt.instance;

//There is also a shortcut (if you don't like it just ignore it):
GetIt getIt = GetIt.I;
</code></pre>
<p>Through this any call to <code>instance</code>in any package of a project will get the same instance of <code>GetIt</code>. I still recommend just to assign the instance to a global variable in your project as it is more convenient and doesn't harm (Also it allows you to give your service locator your own name).</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">GetIt sl = GetIt.instance;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can use any name you want which makes Brian happy like (<code>sl, backend, services...</code>) ;-) </p></blockquote>
<p>Before you can access your objects you have to register them within <code>GetIt</code> typically direct in your start-up code.</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">sl.registerSingleton&lt;AppModel&gt;(AppModelImplementation());
sl.registerLazySingleton&lt;RESTAPI&gt;(() =&gt;RestAPIImplementation());

// if you want to work just with the singleton:
GetIt.instance.registerSingleton&lt;AppModel&gt;(AppModelImplementation());
GetIt.I.registerLazySingleton&lt;RESTAPI&gt;(() =&gt;RestAPIImplementation());
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><code>AppModel</code> and <code>RESTAPI</code> are both abstract base classes in this example</p></blockquote>
<p>To access the registered objects call <code>get&lt;Type&gt;()</code> on your <code>GetIt</code>instance</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">var myAppModel = sl.get&lt;AppModel&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively as <code>GetIt</code> is a callable class depending on the name you choose for your <code>GetIt</code>instance you can use the shorter version:</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">var myAppModel = sl&lt;AppModel&gt;();

// as Singleton:
var myAppModel = GetIt.instance&lt;AppModel&gt;();
var myAppModel = GetIt.I&lt;AppModel&gt;();
</code></pre>
<h2 id="different-ways-of-registration">Different ways of registration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Although I always would recommend using an abstract base class as registration type so that you can vary the implementations you don't have to do this. You can also register concrete types.</p></blockquote>
<p><code>GetIt</code> offers different ways how objects are registered that effect the lifetime of this objects.</p>
<h3 id="factory">Factory</h3>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">void registerFactory&lt;T&gt;(FactoryFunc&lt;T&gt; func)
</code></pre>
<p>You have to pass a factory function <code>func</code> that returns an instance of an implementation of <code>T</code>. Each time you call <code>get&lt;T&gt;()</code> you will get a new instance returned.</p>
<h3 id="singleton--lazysingleton">Singleton &amp;&amp; LazySingleton</h3>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">void registerSingleton&lt;T&gt;(T instance) 
</code></pre>
<p>You have to pass an instance of <code>T</code> or a derived class of <code>T</code> that you will always get returned on a call to <code>get&lt;T&gt;()</code>.</p>
<p>As creating this instance can be time consuming at app start-up you can shift the creation to the time the object is the first time requested with:</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">void registerLazySingleton&lt;T&gt;(FactoryFunc&lt;T&gt; func)
</code></pre>
<p>You have to pass a factory function <code>func</code> that returns an instance of an implementation of <code>T</code>. Only the first time you call <code>get&lt;T&gt;()</code> this factory function will be called to create a new instance. After that you will always get the same instance returned.</p>
<h3 id="overwriting-registrations">Overwriting registrations</h3>
<p>If you try to register a type more than once you will get an assertion in debug mode because normally this is not needed and not advised and probably a bug.
If you really have to overwrite a registration, then you can by setting the property `allowReassignment==true`` . </p>
<h3 id="unregistering-singletons-or-factories">Unregistering Singletons or Factories</h3>
<p>If you need to you can also unregister your registered singletons and factories and pass a optional <code>disposingFunction</code> for clean-up.</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">/// Unregister a factory/ singletons by Type [T] or by name [instanceName]
/// If its a singleton/lazySingleton you can unregister an existing registered object instance 
/// by passing it as [instance]. If a lazysingleton wasn't used before expect 
/// this to throw an `ArgumentError`
/// if you need to dispose any resources you can do it using [disposingFunction] function
/// that provides a instance of your class to be disposed
void unregister&lt;T&gt;({Object instance,String instanceName, void Function(T) disposingFunction})
</code></pre>
<h3 id="resetting-getit-completely">Resetting GetIt completely</h3>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">/// Clears all registered types. Handy when writing unit tests
void reset()
</code></pre>
<h2 id="ready-signal">Ready Signal</h2>
<p>Often your registered services need to do initialization work before they can be used from the rest of the app. As this is such a common task and its closely related to registration/initialization I added a handy little feature for it.</p>
<p><code>GetIt</code> has two properties <code>ready</code>, which is a <code>Stream&lt;void&gt;</code> and <code>readyFuture</code> which is what a surprise a <code>Future&lt;void&gt;</code>.  By calling <code>signalReady()</code> on your <code>GetIt</code> instance <code>ready</code> emits an items and <code>readyFuture</code>is signalled. By this you can wait for the end of all initialization with a <code>Stream/FutureBuilder</code> or just listen to the Stream in an <code>initState</code> method.  </p>
<h3 id="automatic-ready-signal">Automatic ready signal</h3>
<p>In the previous method where you have to call <code>signalReady</code> manually  to trigger the <em>ready</em> event. Additionally all your registrations have an internal <em>ready</em> state if you pass <code>signalsReady=true</code> as optional parameter on registration.</p>
<p>The full function definition of <code>signalReady</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">void signalReady([Object instance]) {
</code></pre>
<p>By calling it with an registered instance you mark its registration as <strong>ready</strong>.
When all registrations are signalled, <code>ready</code> automatically emits an items and <code>readyFuture</code>is signalled.</p>
<p>Typically the registered service will do that on its own like:</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">`GetIt.instance.signalReady(this)`
</code></pre>
<p>As GetIt is a singleton this can also be done from external packages if they use GetIt.</p>
<p><strong>If you have marked any registrations with <code>signalsReady</code> and you call <code>signalReady()</code> while not all of them are ready, an Exception is thrown.</strong> 
So either you use manual <strong>OR</strong> automatic signalling. You can not mix them because in most cases this would lead to state errors</p>
<h2 id="experts-region">Experts region</h2>
<h3 id="named-registration">Named registration</h3>
<p><strong>DON'T USE THIS IF YOU ARE REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!</strong></p>
<p>This should only be your last resort as you can loose your type safety and lead the concept of a singleton add absurdum.
This was added following a request at <a href="https://github.com/fluttercommunity/get_it/issues/10">https://github.com/fluttercommunity/get_it/issues/10</a></p>
<p>Ok you have been warned. All register functions have an optional named parameter <code>instanceName</code>. If you provide a value here 
your factory/singleton gets registered with that name instead of a type. Consequently <code>get()</code> has also an optional parameter <code>instanceName</code> to access
factories/singletons that were registered by name.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Each name for registration can only used once.<br>
Both way of registration are complete separate from each other. </p>
<h3 id="more-than-one-instance-of-getit">More than one instance of GetIt</h3>
<p>Although I don't recommend it, you can create your own independent instance of <code>GetIt</code> for instance if you don't want to share your locator with some
other package or because the physics of your planet demands it :-)</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">/// To make sure you really know what you are doing
/// you have to first enable this feature:
GetIt.allowMultipleInstances=true;
GetIt myOwnInstance = GetIt.asNewInstance();
</code></pre>
<p>This new instance does not share any registrations with the singleton instance</p>
